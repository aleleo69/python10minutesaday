    "When getting a bit more into programming, one might come across two big paradigms in coding: functional programming and object-oriented programming (OOP). Until now, what we mostly did is called functional programming. I have not yet found a satisfying all-round definition for both terms. The key difference is that functional programming, as the name suggests, centers around functions and the program structure is like a step-by-step recipe, while OOP centers around the data, which is structured in objects. It is mostly a different way of approaching a problem. There is no real good or bad between the two paradigms as there is in a preference for tennis over soccer. Sometimes, one approach seems easier for a problem, but I am convinced that you could achieve the same results with both methods. Both, OOP and the functional approach are fine in Python."

    "The core idea of OOP is the abstraction of the program into objects. An object is a structure that combines the data and the code relevant to that particular piece of data. Evangelist of OOP claim that this reduces the amount of repetition and makes the code more readable. I must admit, that the idea is pretty neat and does definitely have some benefits. As a nice starter example, lets create an object for an animal and see how OOP works in Python."

    "This structure does not look that difficult, but there are some new concepts. To start a class definition, you start with the class keyword, followed by a name. As a convention, class names start capitalized, but from I Python perspective, any name would be fine (but capitalize it anyway please). Similar to a function definition, we have a semicolon and all code that is indented belongs to the definition. It is good practice to provide a DocString to describe the class. In the definition itself, we can now create variables and methods. Methods is the name for functions that are in a class definition."

    "It is important to know the difference between the class definition and a class instance. The code we have created in the previous example is a class definition. It creates a blueprint for our object. When we want to use that particular type of object, we need to create an instance. After the definition of our Animal class, we create two instances of that class: animal1 and animal2. While the blueprint defines which data and methods are available, it does not contain the data itself. When creating an instance of the class, we create the object that contains the actual data. In our example, animal1 and animal2 are both of the type Animal but they contain different data: Frog for animal1 and Rhinoceros for animal2. You can create many instances of a previously defined class."

    "When creating an instance of a class, we can call one of Python's special methods: a constructor. We can see that it is special, because its name is surrounded by double-underscores. These, so called dunder-methods are given special treatment in Python. The init dunder-method indicates the constructor, a method that is called when a class instance is created. Methods can take parameters just like regular functions however, classes have one mandatory first parameter: self. Any class method in Python requires this parameter and the reason is that this particular object caries the data of the class. When we define a class in Python, we have a reference to that class. This definition is the same for every object. To have each instance hold their own set of data such that we have a Frog and a Rhinoceros, each class has the self object, which holds the actual data. In the constructor, we add the created variables to this self object. This object is shared between the instance, but not between different instance. Now, we can use that instance data in the other methods we define in the class, such as in the description() method. This is the solution the Python developers came up with for having data at the instance level. While you can define variables at class level, this can result in unwanted results:"

    "The class has two more dunder-methods. The first takes care of the representation of a the class. If we would simply type the variable name representing the class instance, i.e. number1, it will call the repr dunder-method and returns it representation. This has to be of type string, but using the definition, we can make any representation we like. The second dunder-method defines how to add two objects. It expects as a parameter, next to the mandatory self object, the other object. Technically, this could be any object and we have to test which type it is. For now, we assume it will be of the same type and apply the addition. This can be any definition, even something else as we did. This is very powerful as you can define objects like for example contact cards and using the add function, merge two contacts. We have seen an interesting one when we used Path from the Pathlib module. Path has the divide defined such that it combines the path:"

Overloading means that you overwrite an existing method, which can be a regular method or one of the dunder-methods, with a new definition. There are a couple more dunder-methods, for example for iteration related topics. It is not required to know them by hard, but definitely nice to know about their existence."
