# Learning Python 10 minutes a day
This is a [series](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/10minutespython) of
short 10 minute Python articles helping you to get started with Python. I try
to post an article each day (no promises), starting from the very basics, going
up to more complex idioms. Feel free to contact me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisbakhuis/) for questions or
requests on particular subjects of Python, you want to know about.
