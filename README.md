# Learning Python 10 minutes a day
This is a [series](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/10minutespython) of
short 10 minute Python articles helping you to get started with Python. I try
to post an article each day (no promises), starting from the very basics, going
up to more complex idioms. Feel free to contact me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisbakhuis/) for questions or
requests on particular subjects of Python, you want to know about.

This concludes this course. If you liked the course, I would be very happy if
you shared the hard-earned self-generated certificate on LinkedIn and tagged me
along with it. It gives me an idea on who actually did the course and of
course, I will congratulate you on your achievement.  All the best and as
always, if you have any questions, comments, or requests, feel free to contact
me on LinkedIn.
