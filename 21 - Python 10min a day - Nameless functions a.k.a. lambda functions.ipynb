    "For new-comers, the lambda function can be somewhat intimidating. I have also avoided the use of these functions for some time as I never understood the use of them. Nowadays, I do see a benefit of the construct but it is rather small. Still, you will come across these functions and therefore, it is good to know what is happening. Lambda functions are also called nameless functions or anonymous functions which describes them much better. A lambda function is an inline definition of a function which does not have a name. Apart from not having a name, what is the difference between a regular function and the lambda function? Practically nothing! When comparing the byte-code (code that is generated when Python is interpreting code) between the two types is identical. Then the next question is: why to use a lambda function when a regular function does the same thing? Indeed, most of the time, a regular function is the way to go. However, sometimes you only need to do a small operation only once. While you could still use a regular function, an inline function (the lambda function) could be somewhat easier."

We could now create a regular function that selects the second item of the tuple but we only use it once. This means that a lambda function would be perfect here.
