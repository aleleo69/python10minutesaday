    "Python can be seen as a Swiss army knife and comes with many convenient tools to quickly get the job done. A task that arises regularly is interacting with files. Tasks like loading data from a text file to use for analysis, or writing results from your calculation into a log file. Files can be seen as a large sequence of numbers, which are saved to zeros and ones (binary) on a disk. When a human interacts with files, the format is translated back into something we understand, for example ASCII characters (for a simple text file). All this actual storing and translating is done by our operating system."

    "There are different types of files, examples are text files, binaries, images, etc. Each type has their own format and can require a specific recipe for handling. For example, image files can be sectioned into various parts: a header to store general meta-data and a data-section where the actual data of the image is stored (most probably using some sort of compression). In a simple text file, the bytes represent the characters. How these characters are encoded depends on the encoding that is used. In the early days, ASCII was used, which was able to represent 128 characters. Nowadays, UTF-8 is the de-facto standard for character representation. This encoding is compatible with ASCII, but extends the number of characters to over 1 million. UTF-8 uses 8 bits for an encoding, but can combine up to 4 bytes to represent one of the characters. You can probably imagine that setting the wrong encoding for a file can result in errors. Still, starting with UTF-8 is a good guess as 95% of the web uses this encoding."

    "Another thing to be mindful of when working with text files are the line endings. While it seems trivial, for historical reasons, there is a difference in how to encode a new line. Windows uses the ASA (American Standards Association) standard and requires that each line in a text file is ended using a carriage return (indicated as \\r) and a line feed (indicated as \\n). Unix based systems (including Linux and Mac) only require the line feed (ISO standard). You can have some complications sending text files from Linux to Windows and vice versa, so pay attention if you get a text file from another system."

    "For other file formats, i.e. files that are not text, you most probably will use a package. While you can open a file in binary mode, you would have to handle the file format manually. The community has already provided packages to handle many files, most probably also the file-format you want to open. Examples are hdf5, jpg, json, or csv, but there are really tons of other packages to help with handling files. In this tutorial, we will only focus on text files."

This implies that the file needs to exist or Python will come up with the error: ‘FileNotFoundError’. To write to a file, we have to explicitly state the write mode using the string ‘w’. Now, if the file exists it will be opened for writing and if it does not exist, a new file will be created. Be careful, as write mode will overwrite an existing file. To append an existing file, the open function has the append mode (a)."

    "Writing strings to a file can be done using the .write() method. The print() function automatically adds a line feed (\\n) to a string. This is not the case when writing lines to a file. If you want to have a new line, you have to explicitly add the special character to the string. We call it a single character because it will be encoded as a single character. The backslash is a special character to indicate special characters, like line feeds (\\n) or tabs (\\t). It can also be used to ‘escape’ characters, meaning to use the character as text instead of syntax. For example, using a backslash before a quote, will not identify it as a start of a string, but only as the quote character (‘escaping’ the syntax definition)."

    "Reading of files can be done using the .read() method. Python sees text files as an iterable, and separates each item by the line feed indicator (\\n). Therefore, we can use a for-loop to iterate through the whole file. The file object also provides methods for processing all lines at once: readlines() and writelines(). The readlines() method reads all lines, separated by the line feed, and returns the lines as a list (including the \\n indicator in each string). Similarly, the writelines() method writes a list of strings to the file. The latter does not add the line feed between each string in the list. This can be fixed using the join method: ‘\\n’.join(my_list)."

    "After you are done with a file, you have to close the file object. If you fail to do so, depending on your operating system, you might lose data. Some operating systems cache data that has to be written to disk. When the file is closed, the os then writes it to disk as one big chunk to minimize disk access. This helps minimizing IO operations and can also be faster in some cases. This also means that you have to make sure that you close a file properly. Each file object has a .close() method. By simply invoking the function the file is closed and all is saved."
