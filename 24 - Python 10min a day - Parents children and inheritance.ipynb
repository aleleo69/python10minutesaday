    "Yesterday, we talked about classes and how to use the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm to address problems. The objects that we create can mimic real-life objects and the data and methods are all bundled inside the class. We also discussed some of the inner workings of Python: it uses dunder-methods to define interactions between objects. The thing we did not yet mention is seen as a major benefit of OOP: inheritance. Inheritance is the ability to create a new so called child-class that inherits properties from its parent class. Lets first have a look if we would not use inheritance:"

    "Lets now analyze what is actually happening here. The Rectangle class was not changed so there is nothing to discuss. The Square class however has the Rectangle class added between parenthesis in the main definition. Using this syntax we define that the Square class is built with  the Rectangle as a basis and thereby, inherits all of its properties. Next, we define a constructor but as we inherit all the properties from the Rectangle class, we are actually overwriting the inherited constructor. The new constructor only takes the length, as all sides of a square are equally sized. Now comes something special: we call the constructor or the parent class. To access the parent class, Python has the super() function. It returns the definition of the parent class and by directly calling the dunder init method, we can call the original constructor. The original constructor expects a length and width which we supply by entering the length twice. The original constructor adds these values to the self object, the object that holds the instance its data. The new definition also overwrites the repr dunder method. If we would not have overwritten the method, it would use the method from the Rectangle class. Here is another example:"

The new class has to call all other other constructors to initialize the values. We can do this using the super() function, however this looks pretty confusing. The first super() call, without any parameters, calls the first parent class constructor (the most left one in the parenthesis). In the second super() call we pass along two parameters. The first parameter is the Geometry class and the second is the instance object of the class. What is happening here is that we are in the Geometry class which has itself the Color class as a parent. Calling the super(), now accesses the constructor of the Color(). The same happens in the third super() call. In this definition, the Weight class is the parent of the Color class. Calling the super in this way, gives access to the constructor of the Weight class. For the higher level constructors, we need to pass along the self object. In the first level, i.e. the plain super(), it is passed along automatically. This way of writing is pretty confusing to me. Therefore, there is also another way that I prefer and in my opinion looks much cleaner:"
