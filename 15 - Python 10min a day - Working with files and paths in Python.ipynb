    "We have already learned the basics of handling files. Using the open() function we can open or create a file object and using this file object we can read and write a text file. But what if we need to access multiple files? The data that we need to process is often not in a single file but spread over multiple files or even multiple directories. To work with files and paths, there are a couple of standard library packages we can use. A couple of years ago I would always use the glob package for file listings and the os package for file system actions like deleting files. Nowadays, I mostly use the pathlib package from the standard library, which combines the previous two and is platform independent. The pathlib package introduces the Path() class, an object to represent a path or file."

Lets have a look at a couple of examples:"

    "As you can see, the Path() class is very convenient. It comes with a lot of information of the path or file. For example it has a attribute for the stem filename or the extension. Many methods are built-in to extract for example information on creation date, file size, checks for existence, if it is a file or directory, and many more. Also, many file system operations or available. Some of these operations return a new Path() object. All the examples are in my opinion relatively easy to understand. There are some small subtleties which are nice to know. The Path() object is an immutable data type. This means that you can use it as dictionary keys. This is most probably also the reason why the path in the object does not change when you rename a file. In the next examples, we will show how to work with multiple files."

    "To work with multiple files, pathlib has incorporated the .glob() method. It is identical to the glob package where you can find all names according to a pattern. In this example we are finding all files ending with the .txt extension. The result is a list of Path objects, which in their turn open all the previously discussed options. You might notice that the files are not neatly ordered but in the order they occur in the file system. Other things which you might notice is the ‘/’ operator. Path() objects have the ‘/’ operator defined such that you can concatenate paths. We do this in our example with a directory (a Path() object) and a filename (a string)."
