Of course we could use the iPython magic statement %timeit but for the time being lets ignore that possibility. When examining the steps, we see that we have added a couple of steps before the actual function and a few after the function has finished. One way to solve this is to put the timing inside the square_value function. But what if you want to time other functions as well. Because a large portion of the code is live, we can easily wrap functions around functions. Lets have a first attempt:"

This is already a big improvement from the very WET code we created before. However, it still feel tedious to wrap a function around a function for each call. Can't we just define it such that it sticks around? You probably guessed that we can do this. We use the fact that we can define a function anywhere we want and return that new definition.

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), both great web frameworks, use decorators for various things. For example to ensure a function is only used when a user is logged in. Another, almost magical usage is with [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/). When decorating a function with Numba, it uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation to speed up your functions, making them comparable in speed with compiled languages. There are many other usages, [here](https://github.com/lord63/awesome-python-decorator) is a curated list."
