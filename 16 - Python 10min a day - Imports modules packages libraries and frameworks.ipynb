    "We have already imported a couple of things without actually explaining what is happening. Today we will learn that imports in Python are actually quite simplistic. Using imports, we can add functionality to Python. Because Python is such an active and open community, there is a lot to import. Even Python itself comes with an extensive [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) of features (batteries included). For example, the pathlib library gives you file-system super powers. But there are also countless of third party packages and libraries which extent Python or make some kind of function very easy to implement. For example, Flask is a very easy way to create a dynamic website. Pandas adds a new DataFrame structure which is amazing for data science. Almost for any use case, there is some kind of package available."

    "Before we begin, we need to clarify some terms. A file that contains Python code is called a module and has the .py extension. Modules can be imported and generally consists of one ore more functions or classes. If you import a module (another .py file) into the current script, these functions and/or classes become available in the current script. This is a nice way to code DRY and have shareable code. To give structure to multiple modules, you can combine them into a package. A package in Python is nothing more than a directory with all the modules combined and a special file named `__init__.py`. If this file is in a directory, the package can be imported using the directory name. When packages get larger and larger, you can structure them into more folders and create a library. Under the hood, a library is conceptually identical to a package. A framework is a collection of libraries. For example, Flask has many sub-packages for authorization and database interaction. In general, everything you import can be traced back to a Python script."

    "Another concept that is important are namespaces. A namespace defines where a name is known (scope). Python has a global built-in namespace which makes functions like print known everywhere. Inside this namespace, we have the module namespace. The Python program we create, is also known as a module. Each variable we define is known inside this module namespace. This means that if we define on the top of our script that banana=3, from now on, this variable will be know throughout the module. Every time you create a function, it has its own namespace. This means that each variable definition is only know inside this function and cannot be accessed from outside the function. Variables from the module namespace are however, available inside the function."

    "There are two ways of importing our new module. First is a general import, which imports the complete file under its stem filename namespace (name without extension). Because module names can be long (and we are to lazy to type), we can rename the namespace into something shorter using the as keyword. Many popular packages have well-known abbreviations: import pandas as pd, import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, etc. The other method for importing is using the from … import … construct. With this method you can import fractions of a module into the current namespace. The imported items are available as if they are defined in the current module."

The even larger types (libraries and frameworks) are collections of packages, combined in a single directory and are accessed the same way as modules. So when you install a package using pip, a folder with Python files is created. This folder is in to your Python path, a string containing directories on where to look for modules and packages. When we import a module, Python will first look for the module in the current working directory. Next, it will check the Python standard library. If it still cannot find the module, it will iterate through the paths defined in the Python path environment variable. In Python this path is easily accessible through the sys package. Using sys.path you can inspect all paths and even add another path to make the packages in that directory findable."

I had to realize this the hard way, which took me a couple of hours to understand what was happening. To solve this, Python has an additional package called importlib and using the importlib.reload() function we can force a reload of a module."

Of course, there are [more subtleties to learn](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html) but for now, this is probably enough. The most important thing to know is that you can expand Python using packages. The community is extremely active and for almost anything you want to do, there is probably a package to help you. Almost all packages are in the Python Package Index ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/)) so this is a great place to start looking. If, by any chance, you come across something that does not exist, it is generally not that difficult to create. And if you want to get the immortal status, you can upload you package to PyPi in a bliss for other people to use. Sharing is caring!"
