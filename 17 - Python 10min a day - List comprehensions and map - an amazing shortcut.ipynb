    "One of the key elements of Python is its readability. The language forces you to apply structure using indentation which is in my opinion very pleasing to the eye. The key ideas of Python can also be found in [the zen of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python). It was included as one of many Easter eggs in the interpreter (just type ‘import this’). One of the idioms that are pretty cool (and very Pythonic) are comprehensions. Comprehensions, or more often called list comprehensions as they are most often used with lists, is a somewhat abstract way to create lists. They combine some sort of processing step, together with a loop, to populate a new list. To make this more clear, lets compare the traditional step to the cool kid on the block: a list comprehension:"

    "In the traditional loop, you first need to define an empty list. Next is a for-loop to iterate over all calculations, and appending this all to the fresh new list. These three lines can be combined into a single line using a list comprehension, but without sacrificing readability. Inside the list comprehension, i.e. inside the definition of the list identified by brackets, there is a for-loop. This for-loop defines a variable used for the iteration which we can freely choose. Often we are lazy and we choose short letters such as x, y, and z. Still, using descriptive names is a better practice. The for-loop acts identical to a regular for-loop and iterates over the full iterable. We can zip multiple iterables or use enumerate but we need to unpack all the additional variables as well (or use them as a tuple). A good thing to remember is that a list comprehension creates a new list, even if we copy each item and have identical lists. Comprehensions work almost anywhere and can be used in functions. They also work with dictionaries and sets, but of course, the definition must be correct for each data type."

Together with the inline if-statements, it is a simple way to create a filtered list of items. Another, very similar method is the map() function. This functions maps a function over each item of the list and returns a new list with all the returned values.

The map-object is a sort of generator, so it only calculates the value when it is requested. This is in most cases more efficient and consumes less memory. To view the complete list, we convert the map-object into a list. Working with data that is easily mapable as we have done here, is also easier to parallelize (run on multiple cores of your computer in parallel). Python has the multiprocessing package that offers a multi-processing map function for tasks that are CPU-intensive."
